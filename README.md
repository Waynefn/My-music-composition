# My-music-composition
Record some music scores that I composed during 2010-2016.

I don’t have a systematic study of composition. And this is more of a narcissistic interest.

TODO: Upload music file for the score. Like midi format.

### Invention 1
```
Tonal: bB
Instrumenet: Piano/Harpsichord
```
One of my first works. Imitated Bach’s invention music, very short.

## No Title
```
Tonal: a-#a
Instrumenet: Piano
```
Music done on paper first (not score editor).

Because my music level is too low, a minor is always preferred.

## Karuou
```
Tonal: C
Instrumenet: Piano
```
Imitated Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D major.

I like the 5/4 part.

Also because my music level is too low, C major is always preferred.

## Pitch In bE Major
```
Tonal: bE
Instrumenet: Piano/Harp
```
I think the begining is beautiful for section 22-28.

## No Title 2

```
Tonal: f-a-A-F
Instrumenet: Piano/Harp
```
It is very intesting to transfer the tonal from `f` to `a` to `A` to ``F.

##  String Quartet 1

```
Tonal: a
Instrumenet: Timpani/Violin*2/Viola/Double bass
```
...

## New Idea 13

```
Tonal: d-a-bb-a-d-a-bb-a-C
Instrumenet: Piano
```
Some new ideas from Bach.


## Hero's Vengeance

```
Tonal: Atonality-C
Instrumenet: Piano
```
First **Atonality** work.
